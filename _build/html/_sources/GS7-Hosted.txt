Hosted
=====================

Directus Hosted is a highly scalable DBaaS (Database as a Service) platform for developers looking to easily give their clients an intuitive cloud-based interface for managing app/website content.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With a Directus Hosted account you can manage all your instances in one
place, creating new Directus instances in seconds. Simply choose a name
and size for your instance and within seconds you’ll have a new SQL
database ready to completely customize with your project’s specific data
architecture. Use the dynamic RESTful API to pull data into your app or
website – or just use Directus as a standalone tool, similar to
FileMaker. Either way, an unlimited number of users can upload files and
manage database content, all based on granular group permissions.

Your Account Dashboard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From here you can manage your account info, including your email,
password, and payment details. From this panel you can also review your
account’s billing history, see any outstanding balance you might have,
and close your account.

Creating Instances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have added payment info into your account you can easily and
quickly add new instances. Just click on the “Create Instance” button in
the header, fill in an instance name, and choose a plan – that’s it.
Names should be lowercase alphanumeric with dashes instead of spaces –
choose your instance name carefully as that will determine your database
name and API URL. It should only take a few second for your database and
Directus CMS to be set up. Then, once you’ve created a schema and
content, your dynamic API will be available.

Managing Instances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you’ve created a few instances, you can easily manage them all in
one place from the Instances section. In addition to changing your
instance’s plan (resizing), you will also be presented with other
details, including:

-  Table Count
-  User Count
-  Total Item Count
-  Used & Available Asset Storage
-  Used & Available Asset Bandwidth
-  Used & Available Monthly API Requests
-  Used & Available Monthly API Bandwidth

You will also be able to see all of your API users/keys listed here.
Each Directus user has an associated API key that inherits its data
privileges. Keys can be be updated within the instance’s Directus Users
section.

Deleting Instances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can delete instances from their detail page. There are three levels
of confirmation to ensure you do not accidentally destroy instances. The
following is permanently destroyed when deleting an instance:

-  The database
-  All data and content within the database
-  The Directus CMS
-  All associated assets
-  All API endpoints (404)
