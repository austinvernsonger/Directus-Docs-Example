Upgrading
=====================

Step by Step
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below is the process for manually updating Directus. Directus Hosted
Instances are automatically updated.

1. **Backup your database**: In addition to scheduled backups, you
   should always create another complete database backup directly before
   making any broad CMS/database changes
2. Download and unzip the newest Directus package from `here`_
3. Ensuring you donâ€™t replace your ``/api/config.php`` and
   ``/api/configuration.php`` files, overwrite your previous version of
   Directus with the new files
4. Run the migration script to update your database/schema (@TODO)

    Developers who installed Directus by cloning the git repository
    directly to their server can simply ``pull`` the newest stable
    version. Typically this is as simple as navigating to the Directus
    folder and running: ``git pull origin build``
